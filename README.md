# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT App USING CRUD METHOD
## by : Nadya Sarilla Agatha

Hello Everyone,

Thank you for visiting my first project as a Data Scientist Student in Purwadhika. So, I made a mini library management app using the CRUD method. This app might not be excellent, have flaws, or accurately represent the actual workflow, but I tried my best. So let's enjoy :D

This app is developed with Python as the only programming language. The data inside the app doesn't connect to any databases cause it's made by me. 
All the information included in the app is fictional data.

Oh ya, I almost forgot. This app runs using Bahasa Indonesia. So, if you're okay with that let's jump right in :D

## Introduction to the App
Welcome to Perpustakaan Bahagia!
This app lets you manage a library management system. Here is the main feature that is provided in this app :
1. Viewing a list of books.
2. Adding a new book to the list.
3. Deleting the book's data inside the list.
4. Updating information inside the list.
5. Donation books.

Here is the preview from the main menu:

### MENU 1: Viewing List of Books

The first menu shows you a table list of books that are available in our system. This list included the title, publication year, author, publisher, and genre.

### MENU 2 & 4: Adding New Book to the List

The second and fourth menu is basically same. These two menus are designed to add new books to the book list. But, it can be done by filling all the fields inside the list correctly.

Here's the preview from the second menu.

Here's the preview from the fourth menu.

### MENU 3: Delete Book Inside the List
If you want to delete a book from the list you can go to the third menu. This action can be done by entering the index number of the book that you want to remove. But you can only delete a single book in one turn.

### MENU 5: Update Book Information Inside the List
In this menu, you can change the book values from the list. But you can only change the value one by one by selecting the column you want to edit.
